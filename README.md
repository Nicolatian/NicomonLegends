Overview of the Game:
My idea for this project was a small open world area with creature battles just like in the Pokémon game series, I have specifically taken inspiration from Pokemon Legends Arceus. The player controls a capsule or “human” through an open forest, using keyboard and mouse for controls and looking around. The mouse is also used for choosing battle options when a battle is active. The goal of the game is to defeat all enemy creatures on the map. The genre is turn based combat, with open world aswell. 
The main parts of the game are:
•	Player – a capsule, that moves with the keyboard WASD and crouch with C, to hide from creatures.
•	Camera – located on the player, is used for looking around the open world.
•	Nicomons - Self made creatures that spawn at predefined areas with unique stats, models and abilities, each creature patrols around a given area and scouts for potential encounters with the player. If they detect the player, they run towards the player and trigger a battle.
•	Battle - Turn based combat triggered by either detection or collsion with creature. Creatures have unique moves and models. In the battle the player always starts followed by the enemy. They take turns until one of them is dead. All moves are followed by self-made particle systems. When the battle is done the creature disappears.
•	Map - A playing field made with Terrain tool it is a medium small area, with mountains on the edges too steep for the player or Nicomon to pass, acting as a barrier

Game features:
•	The game makes you fight creatures that can be challenging to defeat.
•	Type combinations to keep track of which creature is stronger against which
•	Moves have different power and typing, making you choose carefully.
